Dummy X509
==========

A shell script which creates a dummy CA, server and client cert. Use only for
testing of SSL/HTTPS.

Usage
-----

    ./generate.sh server_ca_name server.alias.example.com client_ca_name client.alias.example.com

Generates a dummy CA cert (pem/crt formats) and a key:

    ca.crt
    ca.key
    ca.pem

A server cert (pem/crt) and a key:

    server.crt
    server.csr
    server.key
    server.pem

And a client cert (pem/crt) and a key:

    client-client_ca_name.crt
    client-client-ca_name.csr
    client-client-ca_name.key
    client-client-ca_name.pem

To generate another client just re-run the script with a different last
argument. The script will never overwrite CA and server certs, but it WILL
overwrite the client cert so use with care.

Aliases
-------

Both server and client certificates have common names (CN) and also an alias
that is generated as Subject Alternative Name extension. Note that in 2020 you
need to have SAN for TLS as most of the modern browsers and OSes refuse
certificates without SAN: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210176

Typically if your server is running under server.example.com you want to set
both CN and SAN to the same value:

    ./generate.sh server.example.com server.example.com client.example.com client.example.com

Have fun!
