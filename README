Dummy X509
==========

A shell script which creates a dummy CA, server and client cert. Use only for
testing of SSL/HTTPS.

Usage
-----

    ./generate.sh server.example.com client.example.com

Generates a dummy CA cert (pem/crt formats) and a key:

    ca.crt
    ca.key
    ca.pem

A server cert (pem/crt) and a key:

    server.crt
    server.csr
    server.key
    server.pem

And a client cert (pem/crt) and a key:

    client-client.example.com.crt
    client-client.example.com.csr
    client-client.example.com.key
    client-client.example.com.pem

To generate another client just re-run the script with a different last
argument. The script will never overwrite CA and server certs, but it WILL
overwrite the client cert so use with care.

Have fun!
